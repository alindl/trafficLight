# Testing environment:
Display connected to laptop that runs the traffic light simulation

We tell participants to imagine walking to a pedestrian traffic light that is red.
Participants encounter the display, showing the prototype in either counter or seconds mode.

They don't get any clues as to what they are supposed to do, we just observe how they react with the prototype.
After that, we ask them some questions about this interaction.

# Questions for the evaluation of the prototype:

- (age, gender)

## Did they react to the prototype as hoped?

### YES

- What does this traffic light do?

- What were you supposed to do at the traffic light?

- How easy or hard was it to understand what you were supposed to do?

- How much control did you have on the time?

- Would you use this kind of traffic light?

- Would you enjoy using this traffic light on a regular besis instead of the old system?


### NO

- What do you think the stick figure animation was supposed to tell you?

- Why did you NOT do the exercise?

  I didn't want to do it

    - Would it have changed your mind if others would have done the exercise? 

- Would you have done any kind of sport at all to make it go green faster?


### BOTH

- How would you have built it to make it easy to understand?

- Is the reward for you that the traffic light changes to green faster motivating enough ?
